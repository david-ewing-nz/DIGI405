    "\n",
    "We dont know what the assignment is about yet, however I am guessing. This notebook analyses the RNZ Climate corpus using the Conc library, comparing **national** (domestic New Zealand) and **international** (global) climate coverage from Radio New Zealand. The analysis applies corpus linguistics methods to examine differences in climate change discourse between domestic and international reporting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach uses the national  as the target corpus and international coverage as the reference corpus, revealing what is distinctive about New Zealand's domestic climate discourse. The idea is that without instrucitons, that this effort will familiarise myself with the Conc library and its application to corpus analysis."

    "- Terms with **high Relative Risk (>2)** are characteristic of New Zealand's domestic climate discourse\n",
    "- Terms with **low Relative Risk (<0.5)** are more prominent in international climate reporting\n",
